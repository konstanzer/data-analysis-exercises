Anomaly Detection is the practice of identifying data points, items, observations or events that do not conform to the expected pattern of a given group.

A brief terminology discussion is in order:
**Anomalies** are observable patterns outside the norm. It's the "exception to the rule."
**Outliers** are observations an abnormal distance from common values in a random sample. It's a judgment call.
Note that the terms "outlier" and "anomaly" are often used interchangeably. Mr. Statistician may call any data point messing up his model an 'outlier,' while 'anomaly' is a data point he wants to keep because it's valuable if caught and costly if missed.
An anomaly may even be an inlier, meaning that the data is anomalous in nature but is spatially close to the mean, mode, or expected groupings.
