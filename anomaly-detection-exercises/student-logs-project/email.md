Hello Zach,

I looked at the student logs data. I was successful in finding some answers using a combination of visualizations and z-scores. I've attached a summary slide as both a png file and a powerpoint. In the slide, I chose an objective focusing on student interaction with curriculum with the long-term goal of increasing student engagement. Of course, you may tailor this objective as you see fit. As for the original questions, these are my best guesses.

    Which lessons appear to attract the most traffic consistently across cohorts (per program)? Data science: 1. Fundamentals, 2. Classification, 3. Python, Web development (Java + PHP): 1. Javascript-I, 2. Spring, 3. HTML-CSS
    Which lessons are least accessed? Data science: 1. Advanced topics, 2. Distributed-ML, 3. Storytelling, Web development (Java + PHP): 1. JSP+JSTL, 2. Fundamentals, 3. Web design
    Is there a cohort that referred to a lesson significantly more than other cohorts? Java: Oberon: Javascript-I, Java-I, Neptune: HTML-CSS, Marco: jQuery, Niagara: Spring, Appendix, PHP: Franklin: Java-III, Javascript-II, Hampton: Prework, Java-I, Java-II, Data science: none
    What topics are grads continuing to reference after graduation and into their jobs (for each program)? Data science: 1. Fundamentals, 2. Classification Web development (Java + PHP): 1. Spring, 2. Javascript-I
    Is there any suspicious activity like scraping? Who are the illicit users/bots accessing the curriculum? 192.171.117.210 is abnormally active throughout log but I suspect it's a staff member, 12.106.208.194 accessed material 3,300 times in three weeks, March 2020

My notebook is available here: https://github.com/konstanzer/anomaly-detection-exercises/blob/master/project/curriculum-logs.ipynb Prepare and acquire files can also be found in the repo. I spent a lot of time isolating the home directory in the path to represent actual lessons. Maybe this cleaning work will be of some use to you.

Good luck with your presentation,

Steven Newton
