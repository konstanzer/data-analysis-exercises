**Logistic regression** is type of supervised learning where a decision rule produces labels to classify data.
Logistic regression algorithms classify data according to a **boundary** or **distance** between points.
Generalizing patterns is the primary goal of a classification model.
Classification can be done on structured or unstructured (not able to be stored in a RDBMS) data and binary or multi-classes.
