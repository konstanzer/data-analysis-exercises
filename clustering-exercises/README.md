**Clustering** is **unsupervised learning** used to group and identify similar observations lacking labels to identify the groups.
It's often a preprocessing or an exploratory step in the data science pipeline.

Groups of data similar to one another are called **clusters**. Clustering generate a new feature that can then be fed into a supervised model.

Formally, similarities are based on vector-based distance functions. Methodologies are partitioned-based clustering (**k-means**), **hierarchical clustering**, and density-based clustering (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (**DBSCAN**).
